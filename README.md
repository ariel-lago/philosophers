# PHILOSOPHERS

## Description
The philosophers project

## Instructions
Open the folder on your terminal and type make.
Now you can run the program by writing *./philo* followed by four or five arguments:
### (1) Number of philosophers
How many philosophers and forks will be at the table.
### (2) Time to die
How many miliseconds can a philosopher go without starving.
### (3) Time to eat
How long they take to eat.
### (4) Time to sleep
How long they sleep for.
### (5) Number of times each philosopher must eat
This argument is optional. If all philosophers have eaten the amount of times they must eat, the simmulation stops
